*Build an APPLICATION OR LIBRARY (preferable in python) that analyzes twitter feeds:  sentiment of text twitter feed.*

## Phase 1
UPDATE 10/7/22 - Progress has been made to set up both Twitter and Google NLP Files. Some test methods have been put down and more will come once use cases are better defined. API Keys have been generated for both and data has successfully been pulled into the Python program. Going forward "main.py" will be built out to fulfill the promises of the MVP.

## Phase 2
### MVP
A command line tool that will return the most talked about companies from the past week as well as the general sentiment surrounding them.

### User Stories
1. As an invenstor I want to know what companies currently have the most buzz surrounding them so that I am better informed going into the trading week.
2. As a journalist I want to know what is being covered and what people are most interested in so that I can tailor my content accordingly.
3. As a business news consumer I want to know what is going on in the world so that I feel better informed.
